<h2 align="center">Making a list and checking it twice</h2>
<h3 align="center">by Jerrad Pierce</h3>
<p>Spending most of his time staring at a blinking prompt, Glugg used to use command line tools to email himself todos. Alas, the system quickly became unmanageable even with ability to bring the full power of the GNU toolset to bear on his <span title="the true UNIX mail system">MH folders</span>. He was familiar with <tt><a href="http://ginatrapani.github.com/todo.txt-cli/">todo.sh</a></tt> but liked having the ability to add tasks from anywhere with access to email. Therefore Glugg was thrilled when he found <tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?todo.pl"><tt title="App::Todo">todo.pl</tt></a></tt>, a <tt><span class="w">todo</span>.<span class="w">sh</span></tt> like interface to the web-based <a href="http://hiveminder.com">Hiveminder</a> service. Besides the ability to add tasks by email, and hand-out special email addresses to others for them to submit tasks to as well, Glugg was fond of the <span style="font-style: italic">braindump</span> action which allowed him to create multiple (un)related tasks at once in his favorite text editor<sup><a href="#footnote_py">1</a></sup>.</p>
<pre><span class="c">% todo.pl ls --tag xmas
#XYZZX Mull cider [xmas]
#XYZZY Get tree [xmas]

% todo.pl braindump</span></pre>
<p><blockquote class="w"> String popcorn & cranberries [xmas] <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;but first: #XYZZY <br />Wrap gifts [xmas] <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;but first: Buy them [xmas] <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;and then: Ship them [xmas]</blockquote></p>
<pre><span class="c">0 tasks updated, 4 tasks created, 0 tasks marked completed

% todo.pl --tag xmas #ls is optional
#XYZZX Get tree [xmas]
#XYZZY Mull cider [xmas]
#XZ001 String popcorn & cranberries [xmas]
#XZ002 Wrap gifts [xmas]
#XZ003 Buy them [xmas]
